# CSharp_Aruco
A small tutorial for Aruco Markers detection in CShap with EmguCV.
I created this tutorial as a teaching material for the purpose of the Computer Vision for Video Games course at Gamagora @ICOM @UnivLyon2.

Feel free to use it.

## What you may find...
- Before commit a66da28, you will find a lot of comments to guide you through Aruco with EmguCV. I purposely excluded proper camera calibration so that you can easily experiment with the parameters of the camera matrix and distortion coefficients.
<br>
- Starting from commit a66da28, you will find a better more concise implementation with true calibration coefficients (for my camera). I also included useful methods that you may have, or not, already implemented during the labs.
